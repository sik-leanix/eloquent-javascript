        <h2>Exercise: The bouncing ball</h2>
        <p>
            Use the requestAnimationFrame technique that we saw in Chapter 14 and Chapter 16 to draw a box with a bouncing ball in it. 
            The ball moves at a constant speed and bounces off the box’s sides when it hits them.
        </p>
        <h3>Hints:</h3>
        <p>
            A box is easy to draw with strokeRect. Define a binding that holds its size or define two bindings if your box’s width and height differ.
            To create a round ball, start a path and call arc(x, y, radius, 0, 7), which creates an arc going from zero to more than a whole circle. Then fill the path.
        </p>
        <p>
            To model the ball’s position and speed, you can use the Vec class from Chapter 16 (which is available on this page). 
            Give it a starting speed, preferably one that is not purely vertical or horizontal, and for every frame multiply that speed by the amount of time that elapsed. 
            When the ball gets too close to a vertical wall, invert the x component in its speed. Likewise, invert the y component when it hits a horizontal wall.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finding the ball’s new position and speed, use clearRect to delete the scene and redraw it using the new position.

    if (lastTime != null) {
        updateAnimation(Math.min(100, time - lastTime) / 1000);
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
requestAnimationFrame(frame);

let x = 120;
let y = 100;
let speedX = 100;
let speedY = 50;

function updateAnimation(step) {
    cx.clearRect(0, 0, 400, 400);
    cx.strokeStyle = "red";
    cx.lineWidth = 3;
    cx.strokeRect(40, 40, 300, 300);

    x += speedX * step;
    y += speedY * step;

    if (x < 45 + 10 || x > 315 + 10) {
        speedX = -speedX;
    }
    if (y < 45 + 10 || y > 315 + 10) {
        speedY = -speedY;
    }

    cx.beginPath();
    cx.arc(x, y, 10, 0, 9);
    cx.fillStyle = "gold";
    cx.strokeStyle = "gold";
    cx.fill();
}
