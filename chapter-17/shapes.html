        <h2>Exercise: Shapes</h2>
        <p>Write a program that draws the following shapes on a canvas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. A trapezoid (a rectangle that is wider on one side)</li>
            <li>2. A red diamond (a rectangle rotated 45 degrees or ¼π radians)</li>
            <li>3. A zigzagging line </li>
            <li>4. A spiral made up of 100 straight line segments</li>
            <li>5. A yellow star</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When drawing the last two, you may want to refer to the explanation of Math.cos and Math.sin in Chapter 14, which describes how to get coordinates on a circle using these functions.
        </p>
        <p> I recommend creating a function for each shape. Pass the position, and optionally other properties such as the size or the number of points, as parameters. 
            The alternative, which is to hard-code numbers all over your code, tends to make the code needlessly hard to read and modify.
        </p>
        <h3>Hints:</h3>
        <p>
            You’ll also need a loop for the spiral (4). If you draw a series of points, with each point moving further along a circle around the spiral’s center, you get a circle. 
            If, during the loop, you vary the radius of the circle on which you are putting the current point and go around more than once, the result is a spiral.
        </p>
        <p>
            The star (5) depicted is built out of quadraticCurveTo lines. You could also draw one with straight lines. 
            Divide a circle into eight pieces for a star with eight points, or however many pieces you want. Draw lines between these points, making them curve toward the center of the star. 
            With quadraticCurveTo, you can use the center as the control point.
