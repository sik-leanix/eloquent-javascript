        <h2>Exercise: Pausing the game</h2>
        <p> Make it possible to pause (suspend) and unpause the game by pressing the Esc key</p>
        <p>This can be done by changing the runLevel function to use another keyboard event handler and interrupting or resuming the animation whenever the Esc key is hit.</p>
        <p>The runAnimation interface may not look like it is suitable for this at first glance, but it is if you rearrange the way runLevel calls it.</p>
        <p>
            When you have that working, there is something else you could try. The way we have been registering keyboard event handlers is somewhat problematic. 
            The arrowKeys object is currently a global binding, and its event handlers are kept around even when no game is running. You could say they leak out of our system. 
            Extend trackKeys to provide a way to unregister its handlers and then change runLevel to register its handlers when it starts and unregister them again when it is finished.
        </p>
        <h3>Hints:</h3>
        <p>An animation can be interrupted by returning false from the function given to runAnimation. It can be continued by calling runAnimation again.</p>
        <p>So we need to communicate the fact that we are pausing the game to the function given to runAnimation. For that, you can use a binding that both the event handler and that function have access to.</p>
        <p>
            When finding a way to unregister the handlers registered by trackKeys, remember that the exact same function value that was passed to addEventListener must be passed to removeEventListener to successfully remove a handler. 
            Thus, the handler function value created in trackKeys must be available to the code that unregisters the handlers.
        </p>
        <p>You can add a property to the object returned by trackKeys, containing either that function value or a method that handles the unregistering directly.</p>
